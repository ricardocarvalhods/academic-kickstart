abstract: "We propose new methods that satisfy approximate differential privacy for top-$k$ selection on the unknown data domain setting, not relying on knowledge of domain universe and without assuming any structure of the data. Different from classical methods, our algorithms only require looking at the top-$\\bar{k}$ elements for any $\\bar{k} \\geq k$. By not requiring knowledge of domain and limiting the elements considered, we enforce the principle of minimal privilege, which requires granting the strictly necessary access for a given task. Additionally, we also design a novel way of optimizing the choice of $\\bar{k}$ based on a dataset while maintaining privacy. We extensively compare our main algorithm to previous works in the same setting and show, both analytically and on experiments, that we outperform the state-of-the-art, significantly improving utility."

Currently, I'm updating the latest version to address reviewersâ€™ comments and will soon release the full final paper.

We also have extensive code to reproduce all the results, in pure python and also notebooks to simplify understanding. So stay tuned!
