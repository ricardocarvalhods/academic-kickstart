I'm Ricardo Carvalho, a Computer Science PhD student at Simon Fraser University (SFU). My current research focus on Machine Learning, mostly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Differential Privacy (DP).

Before joining SFU, I worked as a Senior Data Scientist for the Brazilian Government for over 6 years and carried out consultancy work for companies and individuals interested in connecting data science to businesses.

I also worked for almost a year as Data Science Manager at the Observatory of Public Spending (ODP), leading more than 15 data professionals on projects related to data science, fraud prediction and auditing.
