This year's NeurIPS is here at Vancouver and I'm excited to share that I have been selected as volunteer.

I'll be at the Registration Desk on Dec 9th, Monday morning, from 7am to 12pm, and also will be monitoring doors on Dec 11th, Wednesday afternoon, from 1:45pm to 5pm.

Please feel free to get in touch!
