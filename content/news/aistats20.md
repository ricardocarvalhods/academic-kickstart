After an entire year of doing research on Differential Privacy, I had my first paper as a Ph.D. student accepted to an important conference: AISTATS.

- <u>Title</u>: Differentially Private Top-k Selection for Unknown Data Domain
- <u>Authors</u>: **Ricardo Silva Carvalho**, Ke Wang, Lovedeep Gondara
- <u>Conference</u>: AISTATS 2020, the 23rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics

I'm now updating the latest version to address reviewers' comments and will soon release the full final paper. 

We also have extensive code to reproduce all the results, in python with notebooks to simplify understanding.

Stay tuned!
